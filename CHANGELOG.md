All notable changes to Kanatoko are documented in this file.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-07-23

- Capture coherent mainnet or testnet state from the contracts, accounts,
  trustlines, WASM, and storage touched by a Rust scenario.
- Replay captured state locally in one mutable Soroban environment with no RPC
  fallback.
- Mix captured network contracts, dynamic invocations, generated clients, and
  locally deployed candidate WASM.
- Preview mutating calls with detached results, authorization, events, state
  changes, and resource estimates.
- Fail closed on unsupported protocol versions, unknown ledger keys, and
  incomplete offline fixtures.
